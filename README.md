# lsdregex
A library to streamline formatting and validating Legal Subdivision addresses within Alberta, BC, and Saskatchewan.

The library comes with a small web app to test the code. Input an LSD into the text field and the textbox will auto format to the LSD. Click the button and the LSD will be
validated and display wether or not the LSD matched the REGEX expression for LSD formats in Albert, BC, and Saskatchewan, Canada.
